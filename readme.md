# Introduction
If you are looking to become more independent from massive coorporations like Microsoft, Adobe and Apple or just looking for more privacy?

 If so, this guide is for you.
 
 I do not claim that this guide is complete in any shape or form, it aims to be a quick guide on how to get more free (Free as in *freedom*, not as in *free beer*).

<span style="color:LimeGreen">This Colour</span> means that it's currently my choice. It does not represent superiority of one product over others.

## Why?
The answer is simple: Coorporations don't care about your privacy. They do not only exploit your data, by doing so, they exploit you directly.

It's a basic human right to have privacy; Big Boys in the digital industry do not grant you that right.

**If you had a button which turns off spying, would you press it?**

Chances are that you would press it; That's exactly what you are doing by installing this software and using these services. You are actively showing that you dislike any form of surveillance.
# Operating Systems
<details>
    <summary><font size=4>Desktop Operating System</font></summary>

Instead of using *MacOS* or *Windows*, I highly suggest to use a *Linux* flavor. For ease of use [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) is probably best. Contrary to popular belief, Linux is not only for the tech-savvy, anyone can use it. To be completely honest, some Linux-flavours are even easier to use than MacOS or Windows; many tools provided aim to make your life easier.
1. Download the latest ISO [here](https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=302).
2. Install [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) to be able to "burn" ISO-images onto USB-drives.
3. Take a USB-drive, insert it and open Rufus.
4. Select your ISO file and the USB-drive and click `START`.
5. Your drive is now ready for installation.
6. **Backup your important files.** After installation, you will not be able to recover them. Be careful!
7. With the USB-drive inserted, restart your computer and repeatedly press `DEL`. Then select your USB-drive to boot from.
8. Follow the instructions on your screen.
9. Done!

Instead of using *Android*, [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) is focussed on privacy while still being based on Android. **It only has official support for Google Pixel smartphones.**

Informations on how to install *GrapheneOS* are on their website.
